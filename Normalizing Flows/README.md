# Normalizing Flows

- NICE
- Real NVP
- Glow
- Planar Flow
- Radial Flow
- Neural Spline Flow
- Masked Autoregressive Flow (need MADE)

To Do:
- Flow++
- Deep Dense Sigmoidal Flow
- Sylvester Flow (with VAE)
- Convex Potential Flow
- ResFlow/IRes (problem with estimation gradient)

Investigate:
- cpu memory leak in train_mnist?
- IAF: error (out of [0,1]?)
